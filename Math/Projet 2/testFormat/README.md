# testAuto

### Purpose

This file should allow for a test of your project output in order to check if it
respects the mandatory specifications.

This is not the automatic test under which your project will be assessed : it
will not check for the correct evolution of prices nor for the probabilities'
correctness. This is only a tool for the format.


### Installation

You need a working environment for ocaml (caml.inria.fr or ocaml.org).

Tested under version 4.02.3 of the compiler, should work with any later
versions.

To compile :
ocamlc str.cma -o testAuto testAuto.ml

To launch (other options are available in the help) :
./testAuto

On Windows, you may have to launch with this command :
ocamlrun testAuto

Help (once compiled) :
./testAuto -h


### Problems

Should any problem arise with the installation process, you can contact me by
mail as usual (sophie.bernard@inria.fr or sophie.bernard@unice.fr).

If you are really unable to use this test, you can still post an output file on
the deposit box named "Test format projet 2" on jalon. In this case, the file
MUST be called "output". If this condition is not respected, I will not only not
test it but also not test any further file you might upload. Otherwise, I will
upload the single-file report as a "correction" on jalon. Do not expect me to
see and test your files as soon as you upload it, nevertheless, it should not
take more than 2 to 3 hours during normal week-end day time.
